    "Dark stain spreads outward/Light Stone becomes darker still/Peed my pants again.",
    "You were real to me/You never lied to me/'till you lied to me",
    "Chilling with homies/I need watermelon now/so I used welfare",
    "Puppets are dancing/People are getting angry/The world is changing",
    "And again, he failed,/and a desperate cry rose up:/Goddamnit, Mr Noodle.",
    "The benighted moth/and I, share a common fate/drawn towards your flame.",
    "Look! A shooting star./No, only a satellite/burning through the sky.",
    "black cacophony/you are my sunshine somehow/yeah just uninspired",
    "My girlfriend expands/She swells like a juicy grape/Soil is fertile."
